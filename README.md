# Python-Projects

- A safe space for my Python projects ðŸ˜„

Python is one of the most sought-after programming skills, especially for data analysis. It's not required, but it can definitely make you stand out. These projects display my ever-growing Python abilities and my determination to learn new things that get the job done.

Spotify Data Analysis: In this project, I analyzed my personal Spotify data to extract insights about my streaming history and songs in playlists.
