# Python-Projects

- A safe space for my Python projects ðŸ˜„

Python is one of the most sought-after programming skills, especially for data analysis. It's not required, but it can definitely make you stand out. These projects display my ever-growing Python abilities and my determination to learn new things that get the job done.

Spotify Data Analysis: In this project, I analyzed my personal Spotify data for 2022 - 2023 to explore my streaming history and songs in my playlists. After converting the JSON files into Excel files for easier data cleaning and manipulation, I had over 15,000 rows of data to work with. I also converted the "msplayed" (milliseconds played) column into "minutes played" to improve data understanding. From my analysis, I obtained very significant insights like the total minutes played in the past year, the date and time I listened to the most songs, and playlists with the most songs. I hope to enhance this project as I improve my Python skills.
