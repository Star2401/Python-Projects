# Python-Projects

- A safe space for my Python projects ðŸ˜„

Python is one of the most sought-after programming skills, especially for data analysis. It's not required, but it can make you stand out. These projects display my ever-growing Python abilities and my determination to learn new things that get the job done.

## Spotify Data Analysis
Overview:
In this project, I analyzed my personal Spotify data for 2022 - 2023 to explore my streaming history and songs in my playlists. After converting the JSON files into Excel files for easier data cleaning and manipulation, I had over 15,000 rows of data to work with. I also converted the "msplayed" (milliseconds played) column into "minutes played" to improve data understanding. From my analysis, I obtained significant insights like the total minutes played in the past year, the date and time I listened to the most songs, and playlists with the most songs.

### Summary of Project Steps
- Request personal data from Spotify [here](https://www.spotify.com/us/account/privacy/).
- After the waiting period, download files. Note: The default file format is JSON.
- Convert JSON files of Streaming History to Excel for easier data cleaning and exploration.
- Read Streaming History data into Python for further cleaning and analysis.
- Create visualizations to present insights.
- Read Playlist data into Python as JSON file using JSON library:
```bash
import json
```
- Loop through each playlist to pull data
- Visualize Playlist insights
